# PORTFOLIO CHALLENGE - WEEK 2/3

## Description

I built this site to show case my work so far in the boot camp. I also wanted to put all I had learned so far in the course into practice. 

The page is clean and responsive and provides users with an idea of my work so far, a little about me and how to contact me. 

I like the design but I'd like but on my next iteration I'd like to go bolder and create something really on trend.

One thing I learnt was the importance of commas on a multiple selector in CSS! This one had me stumped until I used AskBCS and was kindly helped.

One thing I noticed however was when using a different device, the logo did not display. I haven't quite figured this out yet so hopefully on the next one I can work this out!
